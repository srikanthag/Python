In Python, the complex data type is used to represent complex numbers, which are numbers with a real part and an imaginary part. Complex numbers are written in the form a+bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. The letter j is used in Python to denote the imaginary unit (in mathematics, this is often denoted as i)

# Define complex number variables
z1 = 3 + 4j
z2 = 1 - 2j

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_z = z1 + z2
difference = z1 - z2
product = z1 * z2
quotient = z1 / z2
magnitude_z1 = abs(z1)  # Magnitude (or modulus) of z1
conjugate_z1 = z1.conjugate()  # Conjugate of z1
