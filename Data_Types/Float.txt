In Python, the float data type is used to represent floating-point numbers, which are numbers that have a decimal point.
It specifies the data stored inside. The memory allocation should be a decimal.

# Define float variables
x = 3.14
y = -0.001
z = 2.71828

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_xy = x + y
difference = x - y
product = x * z
quotient = x / 2
power = x ** 2

** You can convert other numeric types or strings to floating-point numbers using the float() function.
str_num = "45.67"
converted_float = float(str_num)
print("Converted float:", converted_float)
