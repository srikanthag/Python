In Python, the int data type is used to represent integer numbers, which are whole numbers without any decimal part.
Python's int type can handle arbitrarily large values, limited only by the available memory of your system.

It specifies the data stored inside. The memory allocation should be an integer.

# Define integer variables
a = 10
b = -3
c = 1234567890123456789

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_ab = a + b
difference = a - b
product = a * b
quotient = a // 3  # Integer division
remainder = a % 3  # Remainder after division
power = a ** 3  # a raised to the power of 3


** abs: Give only positive integer as the output.
d =-1
print(abs(d))

** round num: round off the number
d =1.95
print(round(d))

** Mathtrunc: Truncate removes the decimal point from a floating point
import math
d =1.95
print(math.trunc(d))


** You can convert other numeric types or strings to integers using the int() function.
str_num = "42"
converted_int = int(str_num)
print("Converted integer:", converted_int)
