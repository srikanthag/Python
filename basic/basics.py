#Python is a programming language with objects, modules, threads, and automatic memory management.

'''objected oriented programm'''

#python is an objected oriented programming language. Everything in python is an object. Using python we can
# create classes and objects.

#Objects: Objects are an instance of a class. With the help of objects, we can access the method and function
# of a class.

#Without creating an Object
class python:
#     def designer():
#         print("Guido van Rossum")
# python.designer()

#With creating an Object
# class python:
#     def designer():
#         print("Guido van Rossum")
# p = python
# p.designer()
