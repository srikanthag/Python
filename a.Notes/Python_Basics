"Python"
a. Python is programming language.
b. Powerful object oriented programming language: Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects
    come into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc. The object-oriented procedure helps to
    programmer to write reusable code and develop applications in less code.
c. Support dynamic memory allocation: In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable.
    When we assign some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the variable at run time.
    Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to x, then we don't need to write int x = 15. Just write x = 15.
d. Python is an interpreted language: it means the Python program is executed one line at a time.
e. Cross-platform Language: Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and Macintosh, etc.
    So, we can say that Python is a portable language.
f. Large Standard Library: It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine learning, web developer,
    and also for the scripting. There are various machine learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc.
    Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.

""" Python Compilation """
Compilation âˆ’ The source code in python is saved as a . py file which is then compiled into a format known as byte code,
byte code is then converted to machine code. After the compilation, the code is stored in . pyc files and is regenerated when the
source is updated.

===================================================================================================================

" Identifier"
User defined name to represent a variable, functions, class, modules ect.

Rules:
a. Name can start "_" or "alphabet".
b. can be alpha numeric but not start with number.
c. No special character except "_".
d. Kewords cannot be identifier.
e. Max char is 79

Note: To check weather python identifier is valid or not >>> "string".isidentifier
